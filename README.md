# Fund_Track
Problem Definition and Objectives:
“Authentication and Tracking of Government Benefits Using Blockchain”

- Objectives
The objectives are discussed below:
• Authenticate/validate the transaction.
• Tracking of funds, end to end.
• Make the process transparent.
• Common peoples will be able to monitor every fund.
• Try to reduce corruption using Blockchain Technology.


We try to develop a system that will help to overcome corruption. Our system
will maintain the records of transactions that are immutable and shared across
many regions. If someone wants to change records he/she will not be able to
change the record.
We try to fill the gap between government and people. Using our system,
common people will be monitoring funds and track the record. Our assumption
is we can overcome at least 30 percentage of corruption if we develop such a
system.
